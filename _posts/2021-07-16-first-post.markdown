### Welcome, stranger! Would you care to look inside my mind?

# An exploration
This is my first ever blog! Well, disregarding one that I wrote in year eleven for a history essay.

My friends:
- Sebastion
- Anthony

are the ones who showed me *how this works*.

1. I love writing
2. I love coding

Hence, **I am writing a blog**!

Check out my [Github Page][https://github.com/peter-mcnair] for more info on how I set this up using Github Pages; it was relatively straightforward and will be supplying endless fun.
