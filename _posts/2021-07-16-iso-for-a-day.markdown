# Preface

It's been a bit lonely having our bro Pete absent during the last three weeks of The Greater Sydney Lockdown 2021. But we also know he has been living it up at uni these past few months. SO, it was with mixed emotions we heard he would be returing due to the worsening situation #thefeelsarereal. Obviously, he had to be Covie tested and isolate before being picked up to come home. I'll let him tell you more about that.
