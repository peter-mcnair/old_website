# Preface
*Freya, July 2021*

It's been a bit lonely having our bro Pete absent during the last three weeks of The Greater Sydney Lockdown 2021. But we also know he has been living it up at uni these past few months. SO, it was with mixed emotions we heard he would be returing due to the worsening situation #thefeelsarereal. Obviously, he had to be Covie tested and isolate before being picked up to come home. I'll let him tell you more about that.

# Why isolate?
I haven't really written about the coronavirus' impact on my life thus far. I suppose I've been lucky in a sense; Australia have handled the pandemic fairly well and I have never felt fearful for my wellbeing. 

That being said, it has not been an easy year. 

I spent six of the best weeks of my life at college, meeting friends for life and exploring the amazing camppus I was lucky enough to live on. Looking at photos from that time, I seem content, as I should be. It all happened pretty quickly in March and I was at home so fast I felt like I'd dreamt college up. 

This year, after the new outbreak I had a nearly identical experience. Same hurried 'get out pls' email, same resigned packing of my clothes, my toiletries, my guitar. Same dream-like trance really.
